1st method is to traverse the whole matrix and find the row with maximum number of 1s with time complexity O(n*m) and space complexity O(1).
2nd method is use the staircase effect with time complexity O(n+m) and space complexity O(1).
code for the second method.
nt i=0,j=m-1,index=-1;
	    while(i<n && j>=0)
	    {
	        if(arr[i][j]==1)
	        {
	            j--;
	            index = i;
	        }
	        else 
	        {
	            i++;
	        }
	    }
	    return index;
	}
