method 1 - first approach is brute force approach with Time complexity O(N^2) and space complexity O(1);
method 2 - second approach is take out minimum from the left with Time Complexity O(N) and space complexity O(1);
Code for the second approach - 
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int maxprofit = 0;
        int minprice = INT_MAX;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.size();i++)
        {
            minprice = min(minprice, prices[i]);
            maxprofit = max(maxprofit, prices[i]-minprice);
        }
        return maxprofit;
        
    }
