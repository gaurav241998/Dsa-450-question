Method 1 - first solution is by brute force with Time Complexity O(N^2) and space complexity O(1);
Method 2 - second solution is by hashing with time complexity O(N) and Space complexity O(N);
Code for the second solution - 
int getPairsCount(int arr[], int n, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            m[arr[i]]++;
        }
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            count += m[k-arr[i]];
            if(k-arr[i] == arr[i])
            {
                count--;
            }
        }
        return count/2;
        
    }
