Method 1 - by brute force method with time Complexity O(N^2) and space complexity O(1).
Method 2- by using hashing or subarray sum in this method we have taken out the sum at each iteration and then store it in a variable then i will check three condition first is
that on any point of time s is equal to 0 or not second is the s sum value repeats or not if it repeats so there is a case before which sum becomes 0 and last case is any number
in array is zero or not.
code for the second method - 
bool f = false;
   int s=0;
   unordered_map<int,int> m;
   for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
   {
       s = s+arr[i];
       if(s==0 || m[s] || arr[i]==0)
       {
           f = true;
           break;
       }
       else
       {
           m[s] = 1;
       }
   }
   return f;
   
   LEARNINGS - 
   1. Think like A boss.
   2. think simple very simple i got new approach to get a subarray with given sum.
